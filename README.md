# MarkTwo Engine

The MarkTwo Engine is an open source 2D game engine using OpenGL. It operates off of an entity component based system similar to Unity's prefab system.

MarkTwo uses SDL2, RapidXML, GLM, and custom C++ classes for creating sounds and drawing images to a window. It also includes a number of 2D art and sound assets used to demo what the engine is capible of.

This project only includes source files. You will need to go on the SDL2, RapidXML, and GLM websites to grab their source files. Once you have their source files, you will need to add the needed libraries to your build system of choice.

The MarkTwo engine is an ongoing project for educational purposes.
